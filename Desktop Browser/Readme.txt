   - There in the "[Variables]" meter you can find the 'WebsiteURL' tag.
   - There you can change the website URL.
   - I give you a background image I used in my website link image that you can edit the photo with your URL.

3. Loading the Skin:
   - Go to rainmeter software icon in your system tray.
